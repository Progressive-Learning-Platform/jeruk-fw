# Development Environment #

The firmware can be compiled with the Microchip [xc32 compiler](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en_us/devtools/mplabxc/). Efforts to support completely open source toolchain will be greatly appreciated! (e.g. pure GCC compiler). Something to do: port jeruk-fw so it will compile with something like [this](http://wise-ware.org/wiki/index.php?n=Pic32.GccPic32).

[MPLAB X](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/home.html) can be used as an IDE to develop the firmware.

PIC32MX270F256B requires at least MPLAB X 2.20 and XC32 1.32
